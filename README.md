## **Overview**

This repository is dedicated to solving programming problems using the C++ language. The problems are categorized into **four difficulty levels (1â€“4)**, sourced from various platforms, and solved using multiple approaches. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for learning, practicing, and improving problem-solving skills in C++.

We encourage contributors to **optimize, refactor, and improve the existing solutions** to make this repository a collaborative hub for high-quality C++ code.

---

## **Features**

- **Diverse Problem Sets**: Problems are collected from various sources such as:
  - Competitive programming platforms (e.g., Codeforces, LeetCode, HackerRank).
  - University assignments and coding challenges.
  - Real-world algorithmic problems.

- **Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Level 1**: Beginner-friendly problems (basic syntax, loops, conditionals).
  - **Level 2**: Intermediate problems (arrays, strings, basic data structures).
  - **Level 3**: Advanced problems (dynamic programming, graphs, recursion).
  - **Level 4**: Expert-level challenges (optimization, advanced algorithms).

- **Multiple Solutions**: Each problem is solved using **different approaches**, showcasing various techniques and algorithms.

- **Code Quality**: All solutions are written with clarity and efficiency in mind. However, we welcome contributions to further optimize or improve the code.
